# Tableau-Project-For-Avocado-
Tableau project to determine the best cities, in the United States, to live in; using the price of avocados. Avocado is used to represent a large scale of consumer goods. Data was taken from kaggle,cleaned and uploaded on tableau. The average price of avocado in some major cities and region in America was analyzed and visualized in tableau. The average consumption of conventional avocado and organic avocado was analyzed and visualized . This analysis is trying to predict that it is much more expensive to live in cities/regions that avocado sales is expensive. According to the analysis, cities like San Francisco and Hartford are very expensive to live in and Texas is a little less expensive, just to mention a few cities. To expand the study a little further ,I had to use another variable to determine which states are more affordable to live in.Data was downloaded from kaggle.com and visualized in tableau. According to the data states like California, Pensylvania,and New Jersey presented as the most expensive cities to live and Arkansas,North Dakota and DC are the cheapest states to live in.
